# verify-lsm-hooks.sh — anchor that pins the LSM hook surface area.
#
# Spec 052/053 + PR-A/B/C/D shipped 5 minimal LSM hooks in
# `crates/sensor-ebpf/src/main.rs`. Each emits its own ELF section in
# the compiled eBPF object. If someone renames a hook, drops the
# `#[lsm(...)]` macro, accidentally cfg-gates one out, or changes the
# sleepable attribute on a hook that NEEDS to load via `lsm/X`
# (non-sleepable) vs `lsm.s/X` (sleepable), this script catches it
# before deploy.
#
# Inspects the built .o via `readelf -S` and asserts every expected
# section is present with the expected attribute (lsm/ vs lsm.s/).
#
# Pre-PR-A/B/C/D the .o had only 3 lsm sections (Spec 052 + legacy).
# After PR-D the count is 7 (3 minimal + 2 legacy + 2 PR-B/D? no —
# actually 5 minimal: exec_min, create_user_ns, ptrace_access,
# bpf_prog_load, mmap_file + 2 legacy = 7). See the EXPECTED array
# below for the canonical list.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/verify-lsm-hooks.sh           # exit 0 if all hooks present
#   ./scripts/verify-lsm-hooks.sh --strict  # also fail if extra hooks
#                                            (catch unannounced new hooks)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — all expected LSM sections present
#   1 — missing or wrong-attribute section
#   2 — .o not built (skip silently for local dev; CI builds first)
