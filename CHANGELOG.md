## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Supervised defender brain with agreement tracking** (Feature 006) — brain observes every AI decision and logs agreement/disagreement. Foundation for online learning and AI override.
- **72-dimensional brain-log** — agent records enriched feature vectors to `brain-log.jsonl` for offline model retraining.
- **Autoencoder as decision signal** — converted from standalone detector to integrated decision signal in the agent pipeline.
- **Shield migrated into monorepo** — `innerwarden-shield` now lives as `crates/shield` in the workspace.
- **Dynamic operator IP protection** — active SSH sessions from trusted operators get session-based expiry protection; agent never auto-blocks the operator.
- **CTL restructured** — CLI reorganized from 40 flat commands to 8 intent-based groups (`get`, `stream`, `action`, `trust`, `config`, `system`, `module`, `agent`) for better discoverability. Old commands still work as aliases.

### Changed
- **Autoencoder trains on clean traffic only** — excludes blocked IPs from training data to prevent model poisoning.
- **Live feed uses rolling 24h window** — shows only real external attacks with attacker IP (today + yesterday).
- **Unified XDP blocklist** — shield and agent skill share one source of truth via `XdpManager`. IPv6 support added. XDP now covers 20 detectors (was 5).
- **Defender brain upgraded to V5 50M** — 3.1M training steps, [72→128→64→30] architecture, with daily retrain at 3:30 AM UTC from production decisions.
- **Cross-module correlation** — baseline anomalies, autoencoder scores, and shield escalation now feed the correlation engine. 4 new rules: CL-044 Silence After Compromise, CL-045 Coordinated Volume Attack, CL-046 Neural-Confirmed Attack, CL-047 Attacker IP Rotation.
- **Shield ↔ Attacker Intel bidirectional** — shield blocks enrich attacker profiles (risk score, block count); known high-risk IPs (risk > 60) get 2x tighter rate limits pre-emptively.
- **DNA Cross-IP tracking** — behavioral fingerprint index detects same attacker across different IPs (VPN/Tor rotation). Emits `dna.ip_rotation` correlation event. No other IDS does this.
- **Attacker intel risk scores in decision pipeline** — IPs with risk > 50 get confidence boost in AI triage, reducing latency and API costs for repeat offenders.
- **README fully updated** — all stats aligned (49 detectors, 47 correlation rules, 2361 tests), CLI examples use new command groups, architecture diagram corrected.
- **Website fully updated** — stats, CLI commands, meta tags, and SEO schema version aligned across 25 files.
- **GitHub About & Topics updated** — description includes 46 correlation rules + 65 MITRE techniques; added mitre-attack, behavioral-analysis, kill-chain topics.

### Fixed
- **Notification spam reduced** — 3 critical fixes: gate repeated alerts, suppress non-threat group summaries, rate-limit action reports.
- **Auto-block gates respect operator/trusted IPs** — prevents lockout during active management sessions.
- **Security: XSS in dashboard** — attacker IPs in onclick handlers now escaped via `esc()` function.
- **Security: russh 0.58→0.59** — removes vulnerable `libcrux-sha3` dependency.
- **CI stability** — flaky timing test ignored in CI, dead_code allows for BrainStats, clean deny.toml.

---

## [0.9.4] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Consolidated satellite modules into workspace** — killchain, dna, hypervisor, smm migrated from standalone repos to `crates/`. Single build, single CI, unified versioning.
- **Neural model advisory-only mode** — autoencoder observes and scores but never blocks or notifies. Safe ramp-up.
- **Operator IP protection** — never blocks active trusted SSH sessions (publickey detection).
- **AlphaZero defender brain embedded** — IWD1 binary (538KB) integrated as advisory decision signal with dashboard UI + FP audit + API endpoints.

### Changed
- **Dashboard UX overhaul** — defender brain panel, FP audit view, action config improvements.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard JS fixes** — duplicate `esc()` declaration, broken script tag in template literal, HTTP actions with auth.
- **eBPF connect/accept IP byte order** corrected.
- **Security: safe_write_data_file for brain-log** (CodeQL CWE-22 path traversal).
- **Dependencies updated** — fancy-regex 0.17, redb 4.0, redis 1.2, russh yanked version resolved.

---

## [0.9.3] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Immediate-threat gate for Telegram** — only real threats (reverse_shell, data_exfil, ransomware, privesc, lateral_movement, container_escape, web_shell, process_injection, fileless, c2_callback, credential_harvest, ssh_key_injection, kernel_module_load, log_tampering, dns_tunneling, persistence detectors) send immediate Telegram notifications. Routine detections (ssh_bruteforce, discovery_burst, port_scan, packet_flood) go to daily digest. Reduces ~70 notifications/day to ~1-3 real threats.
- **Daily notification budget** — configurable `telegram.daily_budget` (default: 10). Critical severity always breaks the budget. Counter resets daily.
- **Daily Security Briefing** — enriched digest with deferred incident breakdown showing what was handled silently overnight. Pre-configured at setup (9 AM, no extra steps).
- **CLI commands** — `innerwarden notify digest <hour|off>` and `innerwarden notify budget <max>` for post-setup tuning.
- **Neural incident pipeline fix** — autoencoder anomaly incidents now route through AgentState buffer instead of writing to sensor's file (was silently failing due to file permissions). 415 detections/day were being lost.
- **Correlated anomaly** (baseline + neural convergence) added to immediate threat list — always pings Telegram.
- **5 new correlation rules** (CL-036 to CL-040) from AlphaZero V4 self-play discoveries.

### Changed
- **Premium Telegram message quality** — all message formats rewritten: structured alerts with severity header + detector label + IP + action status; action reports with shield emoji and confidence line; daily digest as "Security Briefing"; group summaries with human-readable labels.
- **Neural anomaly messaging** — "Neural anomaly: 97% score" → "AI Spider Sense: highly unusual HTTP traffic — 97% anomaly" with training cycle context.
- **Group summaries gated** — non-threat group summaries no longer ping Telegram.
- **All Telegram send paths gated** — action reports (post-AI, obvious gate) and AbuseIPDB autoblock now check immediate-threat before sending.

### Fixed
- **Clippy warnings** — resolved all dead_code, derivable_impl, manual_range_contains, collapsible_if, too_many_arguments warnings.
- **Flaky test** — `execve_event_maps_to_shell_command_exec` used PID 1234 which collided with real CI processes.
- **Correlation rule count** — test assertion updated (35 → 40).

---

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Main branch catch-up with develop** — synchronized mainline with the latest development baseline (spec-driven artifacts, governance updates, and organization improvements) so stable releases include the full current platform state.

### Changed
- **CI license gate compatibility** — `cargo-deny` policy now explicitly allows `BUSL-1.1` for the `innerwarden-smm` dependency path to keep security checks green while preserving Apache-2.0 licensing for the core project.

### Fixed
- **Telegram triage test stability** — provider assertion updated to match operator identifier semantics, preventing false failures in the release test pipeline.

---

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- **License opened to Apache 2.0** — project moved from BUSL-1.1 to Apache License 2.0 across repository metadata and Cargo package manifests.
- **Documentation and metadata refresh** — updated README license badge/section, governance references, and release collateral to keep licensing and project messaging fully consistent.

---

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- **Large internal modularization (agent + ctl)** — extracted decision flows, narrative pipeline, honeypot runtime, incident processing, and command handlers into focused modules. This keeps behavior stable while making future development and debugging significantly easier.
- **Spec-driven artifacts added to repository workflow** — feature specs/plans/tasks now tracked under `.specify/features/` to keep implementation aligned with product intent.

### Fixed
- **ATR rule compatibility on production hosts** — rule loader now accepts mixed YAML shapes for `tags`/`references` (map, list, string) and supports regex patterns with look-around/backreferences via `fancy-regex` fallback.
- **Doctor accuracy for protected configs** — config checks now distinguish “permission denied” from “file missing” so diagnostics are correct on hardened servers.
- **Doctor sudo-protection check** — corrected expected sudoers drop-in name (`innerwarden-suspend-user`), eliminating false warning when capability is properly enabled.

---

## [0.8.5] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **`innerwarden daily`** — simplified command group for day-to-day operations (aliases: `quick`, `day`). Subcommands: `status`, `threats`, `actions`, `report`, `doctor`, `test`, `agent`.
- **`innerwarden configure 2fa`** — TOTP wizard (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password). Protects allowlist changes, mode switches, and detector disable. Brute force protection: lockout after 3 failures/hour.
- **Telegram triage v2** — allowlist and false positive reporting directly from phone. `/undo` shows last 10 allowlist additions with Remove buttons. Auto-learn: after 3+ same-pattern FP reports, suggests permanent allowlist via Telegram.

### Changed
- **`agent connect` PID is now optional** — auto-detects running agents, connects automatically when one is found, shows guided selection for multiple. New `--name` flag to match by process name.
- **Setup wizard redesigned** — 4 clean steps (Experience, AI, Alerts, Protection) with pre-configured safe defaults and review screen before applying.
- **Dashboard scroll** — page now scrolls instead of cramming content into fixed height.

### Fixed
- **CWE-312 cleartext logging** — Telegram operator first_name (PII) was persisted in cleartext to `decisions-*.jsonl` and `allowlist-history.jsonl`. Replaced with static channel identifier across all 12 occurrences.
- **Security hardening defaults** — dashboard now binds localhost only, insecure HTTP guard added, sensitive URLs redacted from logs.
- **redb 2 → 3** — attacker profile database upgraded to redb 3.1.1.

---

## [0.8.3] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Autoencoder anomaly detection** — neural engine learns "what is normal" for each host. 48-feature sliding window, nightly training at 3 AM UTC, maturity-weighted scoring. Replaces V10 classifier.
- **208 Sigma community rules** — imported from SigmaHQ (120 process_creation, 53 auditd, 22 builtin, 8 file_event, 5 network). Field aliasing for eBPF events.
- **ATT&CK Navigator export** — `innerwarden navigator` generates JSON layer for MITRE Navigator visualization. 65 technique IDs mapped.
- **Steganography detection** — 4 LSB steganalysis detectors (Chi-Square, RS, SPA, Primary Sets) with fusion scoring.
- **Cloud provider IP safelist** — prevents auto-blocking Google, AWS, Azure, Oracle, Cloudflare, DigitalOcean, Hetzner IPs (~80 CIDR ranges).
- **Dynamic allowlist** — `/etc/innerwarden/allowlist.toml` for runtime configuration without rebuild. Supports processes, IPs, CIDRs, ports, DNS domains, per-detector suppressions, sigma rule suppression.
- **Telegram alert batching** — groups repeated same-detector alerts into periodic summaries (60s window). First occurrence immediate, repeats batched. Critical always immediate.
- **Deploy script** — `scripts/deploy-prod.sh [sensor|agent|ctl|all]` for one-command production deploys.
- **Canary release channel** — GitHub Actions workflow builds on every develop push, publishes as pre-release.
- **MITRE hunt detector** — 6 new checks: destructive dd (T1485), private key search (T1552.004), suspicious archive (T1560), logging config change (T1562.006), prctl rename (T1036.004), hidden artifacts.

### Changed
- **Setup wizard redesigned** — 3 clean steps (AI, Telegram, Responder) instead of 6. Modules and sensitivity auto-configured.
- **Full argv capture** — eBPF exec events now read full argv from /proc/PID/cmdline instead of just argv[0].
- **Sigma rule engine rewrite** — supports multiple named selections, filters, `|contains|all` modifier, YAML list values.
- **MITRE coverage expanded** — 42 → 65 unique technique IDs via mitre_hunt + multi-technique mapping.

### Fixed
- **15+ false positive sources eliminated** — build tools (cc, ld, cargo), CrowdSec (cscli DNS, http /etc/passwd), Node.js (node→sh), admin deploys (service_stop, discovery_burst uid=0), cloud metadata (254.169.254.169), CDN domains, InnerWarden PAM reads, .git/ paths, profile.d reads.
- **Sigma rules suppression** — noisy rules (Inline Python Execution, Shell Pipe to Shell) suppressed. Dynamic suppression via allowlist.toml.
- **CodeQL CWE-22** — path traversal in threat_report.rs month parameter.

---

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **20 automated response playbooks** — every detector now has a corresponding response path. 14 new playbooks: timestomp, log tampering, privilege escalation (kill + suspend sudo), kernel module load (isolate + escalate), process injection, SSH key injection, crontab persistence, systemd persistence, container escape (block container + isolate), crypto miner (kill + block pool), DNS tunneling, lateral movement (isolate + escalate), web shell (kill + quarantine), discovery burst (forensics + notify).
- **Centralized allowlists** — Falco-inspired allowlists module (`allowlists.rs`) with ~200 entries across 8 categories: SYSTEM_DAEMONS, PACKAGE_MANAGERS, LOGIN_BINARIES, DISCOVERY_ALLOWED, SENSITIVE_FILE_READERS, TRUNCATE_ALLOWED, PRIVESC_ALLOWED, C2_OUTBOUND_ALLOWED. All detectors reference centralized lists instead of ad-hoc exceptions.

### Fixed
- **Neural V10 scoring disabled** — classifier generates false positives on Cloudflare, WordPress, and Docker production traffic. Disabled until replaced by per-host autoencoder anomaly detection.
- **Privilege escalation FP** — InnerWarden's own tokio runtime threads (uid 998) no longer trigger privesc detector. Kernel truncates thread names to 16 chars producing unpredictable substrings.
- **Sigma rule self-detection** — SIGMA-004 (shadow/passwd access) no longer fires when the sensor reads /etc/shadow for integrity verification. Global exclusion for innerwarden uid + sensitive file reader allowlist.
- **C2 callback FP** — agent's outbound HTTP requests (AbuseIPDB, GeoIP, CrowdSec) no longer trigger C2 beaconing detector. Allowlist covers innerwarden, cloud agents, monitoring tools, web servers.
- **Discovery burst FP** — bpftool (kernel integrity collector), Ubuntu MOTD scripts (00-header, run-parts), and admin tools (cargo, git, journalctl) added to allowlist. Cooldown increased from 5 min to 30 min.
- **Truncate event noise** — expanded allowlist for system daemons (irqbalance, ufw, fail2ban, landscape, tokio-rt-worker).

### Security
- Red team re-validated with allowlists: **41/42 MITRE techniques detected (98%)** — zero blind spots introduced by allowlists.

---

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **eBPF timestomp detection** — kprobe on `vfs_utimes` detects file timestamp manipulation (MITRE T1070.006). Catches `touch -t`, `touch -r`, `utimensat` syscall.
- **eBPF log truncation detection** — kprobe on `do_truncate` detects log file truncation (MITRE T1070.003). Catches `truncate -s 0`, shell redirects (`> /var/log/syslog`).
- **Defense evasion detectors** — userspace patterns for timestomp (`touch -t`, `touch -d`, `touch -r`), log tampering (truncate/clear), LD_PRELOAD injection, history clearing, process injection via ptrace.
- **Discovery burst detector** — alerts on 5+ reconnaissance commands (ps, id, whoami, ss, cat /etc/passwd, etc.) from same user within 60 seconds. Catches MITRE T1087, T1082, T1016, T1049, T1057.

### Changed
- **Detection rate** — 86% → **95%** (42/42 MITRE ATT&CK techniques detected in red team).
- **eBPF hooks** — 38 active → **40 active** (timestomp + truncate kprobes fixed).
- **Tests** — 1,548 → **1,798** passing.
- **Neural scoring** — V10 classifier **disabled** in production. Generates false positives on WordPress/Docker/Cloudflare traffic. Will be replaced by per-host autoencoder anomaly detection in future release. Rules + kill chain + 48 detectors provide 95% detection without ML.
- **Discovery burst cooldown** — 5 min → 30 min. Expanded allowlist: cargo, git, journalctl, systemctl, landscape, apt-check.

### Fixed
- **eBPF verifier rejection** — utimensat/truncate kprobes were rejected by BPF verifier due to `?` operator after `EVENTS.reserve()` leaking ring buffer reference (Aya's `RingBufEntry` has no `Drop` impl). Fixed by using `if let Ok(comm)` pattern, `#[inline(always)]`, and mutable reference instead of raw pointer dereference.
- **Privilege escalation false positives** — innerwarden's own tokio runtime threads (truncated comm: "en-agent", "rden-dna", "illchain", "n-shield") were detected as privilege escalation. Fixed by filtering service uid 998.
- **Truncate event noise** — system daemons (systemd-journal, logrotate, rsyslogd, irqbalance, ufw, fail2ban, sshd, tokio-rt-worker, landscape) filtered from truncate/timestomp events. Non-root truncate always alerts.
- **Stale loader comments** — eBPF syscall collector comments updated to match current kprobe attribute usage.

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Native DNS capture** — AF_PACKET raw socket on UDP:53. Parses domain + query type. Feeds dns_tunneling detector. No Suricata needed.
- **Native HTTP capture** — AF_PACKET on TCP:80/8080/8443/8787/3000/5000/9090. Parses method/path/Host/User-Agent. Feeds web_scan + user_agent_scanner.
- **TLS fingerprinting** — captures ClientHello, computes JA3 (MD5) and JA4. 10 known malicious fingerprints (Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Emotet, etc.).
- **Neural scoring model V10** — trained on 2.1M production events, 94.6% F1 cross-validated. 58KB model, microsecond inference.
- **Monthly threat report** — auto-generated on 1st of each month. Top attackers, MITRE heatmap, campaigns, trends.
- **Pcap capture** — selective packet capture on High/Critical incidents. Spawns tcpdump for 60s per attacker IP.

### Changed
- **Correlation rules** — 23 → 30 (4 gym-discovered + 3 red team gaps).
- **Detectors** — 40 → 48 (dns_tunneling, data_exfil_ebpf, discovery_burst, + others).

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Agent Guard** — new `innerwarden-agent-guard` crate for AI agent protection. Auto-detects agents (OpenClaw, ZeroClaw, Claude Code, Aider, Cursor, +15 more), monitors tool calls, blocks credential exposure and data exfiltration. Three-layer defense: warn → shadow → kill.
- **Agent Guard CLI** — `innerwarden agent add/scan/connect/status/list` commands for managing AI agents on the server. Interactive menu, guided install, auto-detection via `/proc` scan.
- **Agent Guard API** — `POST /api/agent-guard/connect`, `GET /api/agent-guard/agents`, `POST /api/agent-guard/disconnect`. Agents self-register with InnerWarden and receive policy + check-command URL.
- **Sensitive path write protection** — LSM hook on `security_file_open` blocks unauthorized writes to `/etc/shadow`, `sudoers`, `authorized_keys`, `crontab`, `systemd units`, `ld.so.preload`, `PAM`. Observe by default, block in guard mode (`LSM_POLICY` key 1).
- **io_uring monitoring** — eBPF tracepoints on `io_uring_submit_sqe`/`io_uring_submit_req` + `io_uring_create`. Closes the biggest blind spot in eBPF security (io_uring bypasses syscall monitoring). Alerts on CONNECT, ACCEPT, OPENAT, URING_CMD. Handles kernel 6.4+ rename.
- **Container drift detection** — eBPF overlayfs upper-layer check at execve (Falco trick: `__upperdentry` at `inode_ptr + sizeof(struct inode)`). Detects binaries dropped after container start. `INODE_SIZE` map populated from kernel BTF at runtime.
- **Host drift detection** — flags execution from non-standard paths (`/tmp`, `/dev/shm`, `/var/www`). Trusted path allowlist, package manager awareness.
- **Capability-based guard mode** — 10 capability bits (`CAP_WRITE_CREDENTIALS`, `CAP_WRITE_SSH`, `CAP_IO_URING`, etc.) in `CGROUP_CAPABILITIES` and `COMM_CAPABILITIES` BPF maps. Per-cgroup and per-process fine-grained permissions replace hardcoded allowlists.
- **ISO 27001 A.13.2** — Information transfer control added. Dashboard now shows 13 controls (was 12).
- **Telegram dev mode** — `dev_mode = true` adds "Check FP" button to every notification. Logs flagged incidents to `fp-review.jsonl` for detector tuning.
- **Property-based tests** — 12 proptest invariants across all 4 new detectors via `proptest` crate.

### Changed
- **Dashboard UX overhaul** — integration cards grouped into 5 collapsible categories (Core, Kernel Hardening, Alerts, Threat Intel, External). Top Action widget surfaces most urgent incidents. Collectors split into active/available. Compliance progress bar with actionable items. Report hero KPIs. Journey TL;DR narrative. Threats panel widened to 380px with search feedback.
- **Default `allowed_skills`** — now includes all block backends (iptables, nftables, pf), not just ufw.
- **Detector count** — 36 → 40 detectors (sensitive_write, io_uring_anomaly, container_drift, host_drift).
- **eBPF hooks** — 22 → 25 hooks (io_uring_submit, io_uring_create, LSM file_open).

### Fixed
- Rate anomaly empty IP — packet_flood detector tracks per-IP connection counts; top offending IP reported instead of empty string.
- Block skill failures — AI parser rejects empty IPs in fallback path. `execute_decision` logs actual failure reason instead of misleading "no block skill available".
- macOS install — `BASH_SOURCE[0]` removed from curl-piped path, `NEXT_GID` scoping on re-install, exact dscl grep matches, quoted install variables.
- 16 pre-existing clippy warnings fixed (exposed by new `lib.rs` target).
- C2 allowlist — web servers and databases no longer trigger false C2 callback alerts.
- Ollama local detection in `innerwarden setup` + macOS config path fix.

---

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **macOS install** - `BASH_SOURCE[0]` is unavailable when piping install.sh from curl; macOS now creates the `innerwarden` group via dscl before the user; binaries installed with group `wheel` instead of `root`. Fix NEXT_GID scoping on re-install, exact dscl grep matches, quoted variables. (PR #35 by @aya + follow-up)
- **Rate anomaly empty IP** - packet_flood detector now tracks per-IP connection counts in each minute bucket. Rate anomaly incidents report the top offending IP instead of empty string, eliminating repeat-offender noise with no actionable IP.
- **Block skill failures** - AI parser fallback path (`block-ip-*` skill IDs) now rejects empty IPs instead of passing them through. `execute_decision` early-rejects empty IPs and logs actual failure reason when firewall skill execution fails (was misleading "no block skill available").
- **Default allowed_skills** - all block backends (iptables, nftables, pf) now included in default whitelist, not just ufw. Users overriding `block_backend` no longer silently fall out of the allowed list.
- **C2 allowlist** - web servers (nginx, apache, caddy, traefik, haproxy, envoy) and databases (postgres, mysql, redis, mongodb) added to C2 callback allowlist to prevent false positives on outbound connections.
- **Ollama local detection** - `innerwarden setup` now detects local Ollama instances correctly; macOS config path uses `~/.config/innerwarden/` instead of `/etc/innerwarden/`.
- **Memory badge** - sensor 55MB + agent 26MB confirmed under 100MB badge threshold.

---

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **C2 callback: gomon on port 443** - monitoring processes (gomon, prometheus, telegraf) were skipped only for non-C2 ports. Port 443 (HTTPS) is in the C2 port list, so regular HTTPS health checks from monitors triggered beaconing alerts. Now verified infra processes are skipped from all C2 checks (beaconing, exfil, port). Binary path verification via `/proc/PID/exe` prevents evasion.
- **user_creation: NSS cache hooks** - `usermod` invokes `/usr/sbin/nscd` and `/usr/sbin/sss_cache` as NSS cache invalidation hooks after user modifications. These were detected as suspicious user management commands. Now skipped when the command target is a known system utility path.
- **README** - architecture diagram updated: 19 tracepoints (was 18), 1 kprobe (was 2), kill chain 8 patterns shown in LSM box, mesh network box added, 12 skills listed. Skills table includes kill-chain-response.

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Kill chain pipeline E2E** - sensor now creates Critical incidents from `lsm.exec_blocked` events (was only emitting events, agent never saw them). Full pipeline tested: kill chain trigger to sensor incident to AI triage (Feynman 0.95) to Telegram notification.
- **Agent auto-enable LSM** - `should_auto_enable_lsm()` correctly triggers on kill chain incidents. Fixed `Path::exists()` pre-check that failed without root (agent runs as `innerwarden` user). Added sudoers for `innerwarden` user to run bpftool.
- **`AiAction::KillChainResponse`** - new AI action variant for the kill-chain-response skill. AI parser now recognizes `kill-chain-response` and `block-ip-*` skill IDs (was defaulting to Ignore).
- **Mesh broadcast on block** - when the agent blocks an IP (via AI decision), it broadcasts to mesh peers (Layer 2.5 in the layered block). Previously mesh signals only came from test nodes.
- **Mesh peer discovery** - agent now calls `discover_peers()` on startup and `rediscover_if_needed()` on each mesh tick. Nodes that weren't up during initial discovery are found later.
- **Verified infra allowlist** - `is_verified_infra_process()` helper checks `/proc/PID/exe` binary path. Prevents evasion by renaming a malicious binary to "crowdsec" or "nginx". Only allows processes from `/usr/`, `/opt/`, `/snap/`, `/bin/`, `/sbin/`.
- **Mesh tick logging** - agent logs `mesh tick staged=N new_blocks=N` on each mesh tick for observability.

### Fixed
- **Kill chain: 5 handlers chain_flag ordering** - bind, listen, ptrace, mprotect, and openat set chain flags AFTER noise filters, allowing allowlisted processes to evade detection. Fixed: move chain_flag BEFORE `is_comm_allowed`/`is_cgroup_allowed`.
- **Kill chain: `bpf_probe_read_user_str_bytes` on sockaddr_in** - string-read helper stops at null bytes in binary struct (sockaddr_in family 0x0002 has null second byte). Port/addr always read as 0. Fixed: use `bpf_probe_read_user`.
- **Kill chain: dup2/dup3 fallback on aarch64** - dup2 syscall doesn't exist on aarch64, need dup3 fallback. Server code was missing the fallback.
- **Sensor pin management** - `map.pin()` fails with EEXIST when old pin from previous sensor instance exists. Fixed: `remove_file()` before `pin()` for LSM_POLICY, blocklist, and allowlist maps.
- **AbuseIPDB auto-block: ghost blocks** - the auto-block inserted IP into `state.blocklist` BEFORE `execute_decision()`. If the block failed (XDP map missing, ufw error), the IP was still marked as "blocked", causing the AI gate to skip all future detections. Real attacker 144.31.137.41 exploited this. Fixed: insert AFTER execution, verify result.
- **Mesh peer dedup** - config peers with empty `public_key` matched `""==""`, causing only the first peer to be added. Fixed: dedup by endpoint instead of node_id.
- **False positives eliminated:**
  - `fileless:runc` (15+/2h) - Docker container runtimes (runc, crun, containerd-shim) legitimately execute from memfd.
  - `privesc:(en-agent)` (6/2h) - innerwarden agent/sensor added to LEGITIMATE_ESCALATION with starts_with matching.
  - `outbound_anomaly:nginx` - reverse proxies (nginx, haproxy, envoy, caddy, traefik) and monitors excluded.
  - `dns_tunneling:crowdsec` - CrowdSec, gomon, systemd-resolved excluded from eBPF DNS checks.
  - `c2_callback:gomon` - monitoring processes excluded from beaconing/exfil checks.
  - `c2_callback:169.254.169.254` - cloud metadata service (Oracle/AWS/GCP) excluded.
  - `c2_callback:port 0` - DNS resolution artifacts excluded.
  - `privesc:fwupdmgr` - firmware update manager added to legitimate escalation list.

### Changed
- **Mesh crate updated** to `bed8512` (periodic re-discovery, peer dedup by endpoint, rediscover_if_needed in example).
- **innerwarden-mesh** - 3 bug fix releases: discover_peers, peer dedup, example rediscovery.

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Kill chain integration** — kernel-detected attack patterns now flow into the full agent pipeline. AI receives `KILL CHAIN INTELLIGENCE` section in prompts with pattern name, C2 IP, process details, and syscall timeline. Dramatically increases response confidence.
- **Kill chain response skill** — new `kill-chain-response` atomic skill: kills process tree, blocks C2 IP via XDP, captures forensics (`ss`, `/proc` snapshot) in a single action.
- **DATA_EXFIL pattern (8th kill chain pattern)** — new `CHAIN_SENSITIVE_READ` bit flag (bit 8) set when `openat` accesses `/etc/shadow`, `.ssh/`, `.aws/`, credential files. Combined with `CHAIN_SOCKET`, detects data exfiltration without `execve`.
- **IPv6 XDP wire-speed blocking** — new `BLOCKLIST_V6` and `ALLOWLIST_V6` BPF HashMaps with 16-byte keys. XDP program now parses both EtherType `0x0800` (IPv4) and `0x86DD` (IPv6). `block-ip-xdp` skill auto-detects IP version.
- **EFI Runtime Services kprobe (EXPERIMENTAL)** — observational kprobe on `efi_call_rts` to establish firmware behavioral baseline. Monitors UEFI Runtime Services calls (GetVariable, SetVariable, GetTime). Tagged as experimental in all events.
- **Kill chain metrics in dashboard** — `/api/status` includes `kill_chain` counters (total blocked, pre-chain, per-pattern). Dashboard shows Kill Chain integration card with live stats.
- **Kill chain timeline visualization** — incidents with kill chain evidence render as visual timelines showing the syscall sequence with blocked steps highlighted in red.

### Fixed
- **Telegram 4096-char message limit** — all message types now enforced with 4000-char hard limit before POST. Prevents silent message rejection by Telegram API.
- **Telegram rate limiting** — 50ms minimum gap between sends (~20 msg/sec), prevents 429 errors during incident bursts.
- **Telegram bot token in logs** — all log output now sanitizes the bot token from API URLs (`***REDACTED***`).
- **Telegram callback IP validation** — `quick:block:` callbacks validate IP format before processing. Rejects malformed input.
- **Telegram config validation** — startup now validates `bot_token`, `chat_id` are set when enabled, and `daily_summary_hour` is 0-23. Fails fast on misconfiguration.
- **Daily digest truncation** — lowered from 3800 to 3500 chars to account for HTML escaping expansion.

### Changed
- 8 kill chain patterns (was 7): reverse shell, bind shell, code inject, exploit-to-shell, inject-to-shell, exploit-to-C2, full exploit, **data exfiltration**.
- 9 monitored syscall bit flags (was 8): added `CHAIN_SENSITIVE_READ`.
- `block_backend` default recommendation changed to `"xdp"` for wire-speed blocking.
- Skill registry now has 12 skills (was 11): added `kill-chain-response`.

---

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Trusted Advisor model** - new `POST /api/advisor/check-command` endpoint tracks advisory recommendations with `advisory_id`. When an AI agent ignores a deny and executes the command, Inner Warden detects it via eBPF/auditd and notifies the server owner via Telegram.
- **Admin action audit log** - hash-chained `admin-actions-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` records every CLI and dashboard admin action (enable, disable, configure, block, allowlist, mesh) with operator identity and parameters.
- **Session-based authentication** - `POST /api/auth/login` returns a Bearer token. Configurable timeout (default 8h) and max concurrent sessions (default 5). Login/logout audited.
- **GDPR data subject commands** - `innerwarden gdpr export --entity <ip-or-user>` and `innerwarden gdpr erase --entity <ip-or-user>` with hash chain recomputation after erasure.
- **Privacy documentation** - `docs/privacy.md` with data categories, third-party flows, retention schedule, and data subject rights.
- **GitHub Wiki** - all documentation moved to Wiki as single source of truth. `docs/` folder now redirects to Wiki.

### Changed
- **Documentation consolidation** - replaced 10 docs/ markdown files with a single redirect to the GitHub Wiki. Images preserved.
- **OpenClaw skill rewritten** - uses `INNERWARDEN_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` env var (not interactive passwords), explicit privilege approval rules, passes ClawHub security scan.
- **All em-dashes removed** - replaced with hyphens, commas, or periods across the entire codebase (181 files), Wiki (8 files), and site (6 files).

### Fixed
- **GitHub Actions pinned** - validate-modules.yml and stale.yml actions pinned to SHA (was using tags).
- **sensor-ebpf version** - bumped from 0.3.0 to 0.4.4 (was out of sync with workspace).
- **.gitignore** - added `crates/sensor-ebpf/target/`, removed duplicate `.claude/` entry.

---

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-25

### Security

- **eBPF parser hardening** - replaced 69 `.try_into().unwrap()` calls in ring buffer parsing with safe macros that continue on malformed events instead of crashing the sensor.
- **Sudoers TOCTOU fix** - replaced predictable `/tmp/innerwarden-sudoers-<PID>` with `tempfile::Builder` (exclusive create, random suffix).
- **Sudoers wildcard constraints** - narrowed `*` wildcards in sudoers rules to `/tmp/innerwarden-*` and `/etc/sudoers.d/innerwarden-*` paths only.
- **Sudoers filename validation** - `SudoersDropIn::path()` now rejects names containing `/`, `..`, or special characters.
- **Dashboard X-Forwarded-For** - proxy headers only trusted when connecting IP is in `dashboard.trusted_proxies` config (default: empty, trust nothing).
- **AI provider HTTPS enforcement** - `http://` base URLs rejected for remote hosts (allowed only for localhost/127.0.0.1/::1).
- **Config file permission warning** - agent warns on startup if `agent.toml` is readable by group/other users.
- **Honeypot handoff injection fix** - replaced `{target_ip}` placeholder expansion in command args with environment variables (`INNERWARDEN_SESSION_ID`, `INNERWARDEN_TARGET_IP`, etc.).
- **Honeypot allowlist path traversal fix** - `is_command_allowed()` now uses `fs::canonicalize()` to resolve symlinks and `../` before matching.
- **Supply chain: pin innerwarden-mesh** - dependency pinned to commit hash instead of branch master.
- **CTL temp file hardening** - all `/tmp/innerwarden-*` paths in CTL replaced with `tempfile::Builder`.
- **Dashboard security headers** - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` on all responses.
- **SSE connection limit** - max 50 concurrent SSE streams, returns 429 on overflow.
- **Event size enforcement** - JSONL sink skips events exceeding 16KB with a warning.

### Fixed

- **Live feed filter typo** - `(imesyncd)` → `(timesyncd)` in system daemon privesc filter.
- **cargo fmt** - trailing whitespace in dashboard.rs that broke CI.

### Changed

- **README overhaul** - full ASCII architecture diagram, eBPF/detector count badges, all em-dashes removed, warning moved to disclaimer section.

---

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Firmware & boot integrity collector** - monitors ESP binaries, UEFI variables (SecureBoot, DBX, PK, KEK), ACPI tables, DMI/SMBIOS, and kernel tainted flag every 5 minutes. Detects BlackLotus, LoJax, MosaicRegressor, ACPI rootkits. Based on Peacock (arxiv:2601.07402) and UEFI Memory Forensics (arxiv:2501.16962).
- **Firmware & boot hardening checks** - `innerwarden harden` now checks Secure Boot status, kernel tainted flags, TPM presence, boot loader permissions, IOMMU, and kernel lockdown mode.
- **redb persistent state store** - agent state (cooldowns, block counts) stored in embedded database instead of unbounded HashMaps. Heap stays stable regardless of attack volume.
- **eBPF bytecode embedded in sensor binary** - `include_bytes!()` bakes the 54KB bytecode into the sensor. Single binary deploy, `innerwarden upgrade` updates everything.
- **Shield → Telegram notifications** - escalation/de-escalation events sent to Telegram with state, drops/sec, attacker count, Cloudflare proxy status.
- **Shield → JSONL incidents** - escalation events written to incidents file for live feed visibility.
- **Live feed shows all incidents** - removed IP-only filter, now displays Shield escalations, privilege escalation, rootkit indicators, and all detector types.
- **CLI improvements** - `innerwarden list` shows full system coverage (22 hooks, 36 detectors), `innerwarden status <IP>` searches incidents, `innerwarden test` shows injected incident details.

### Fixed
- **Shield warmup** - ignores first 10 seconds of backlog to prevent false escalation on boot.
- **Live feed internal filter** - hides Inner Warden's own privilege escalation (agent/shield/sensor doing setuid for skills).
- **Unused imports** in firmware_integrity collector.

### Changed
- **3 HashMaps migrated to redb** - decision_cooldowns, notification_cooldowns, block_counts now persistent and bounded.

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-25

- **Site disclaimer updated**
- **Auto-scroll removed** from live feed

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-23

### New detectors
- **Fileless malware** - detects execution via memfd_create, /proc/self/fd, deleted binaries
- **Log tampering** - detects unauthorized access to auth.log, syslog, wtmp, btmp
- **DNS tunneling** - Shannon entropy analysis on subdomains + eBPF fallback for port 53 beaconing (works without Suricata)
- **Lateral movement** - detects internal SSH scanning, port scanning, and sensitive service probing on private networks

### Agent improvements
- **Adaptive blocking** - repeat offenders get escalating TTL (1h → 4h → 24h → 7d)
- **Local IP reputation** - per-IP scoring persisted to disk, exposed in live-feed API
- **Automated forensics** - captures /proc/{pid}/ data (cmdline, exe, fds, network, memory maps) on High/Critical incidents with PID
- **Configurable AI gate** - `ai.min_severity` setting: "high" (default, conservative) or "medium" (aggressive, more API calls)
- **Honeypot always-on mode** - SSH honeypot with AI-powered fake shell, accepts password auth to lure attackers
- **Live feed API** - real daily totals (total_today, total_blocked, total_high), honeypot sessions endpoint, server-side GeoIP proxy

### Hardening advisor
- **TLS/SSL check** - audits nginx, apache, and OpenSSL configs for deprecated protocols, weak ciphers, missing HSTS
- **Crontab audit** - scans for suspicious entries (download+execute, reverse shells, base64)
- **Kernel modules** - detects known rootkits (diamorphine, reptile, etc)
- **Accepted risks** - `/etc/innerwarden/harden-ignore.toml` for environment-specific exceptions
- **Accuracy fixes** - excludes Inner Warden/Docker services from findings, uses `sudo ufw status verbose`

### Security fixes
- Path validation for ip-reputation and sensors API (CodeQL CWE-22 #37, #38)

---

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-22

### Hardening advisor + live threat feed

- **`innerwarden harden`** - security hardening advisor that scans SSH, firewall, kernel params, file permissions, pending updates, Docker config, and exposed services. Prints actionable fix commands with severity scoring (0-100). Advisory only - never applies changes.
- **Live threat feed API** - public `/api/live-feed` and `/api/live-feed/stream` (SSE) endpoints with CORS for real-time incident display on external sites. Includes `/api/live-feed/geoip` proxy for server-side GeoIP batch lookups.
- **Dashboard bind fix** - `tower-http` CORS layer added to agent for cross-origin live feed access.

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-21

### Deep kernel security + intelligent response

- **XDP wire-speed firewall** - blocks IPs at the network driver level (10M+ pps drop rate). Pinned BPF map at `/sys/fs/bpf/innerwarden/blocklist` managed by agent via bpftool.
- **kprobe privilege escalation** - hooks kernel `commit_creds` function to detect real-time uid transitions from non-root to root through unexpected paths.
- **LSM execution blocking** - BPF LSM hook on `bprm_check_security` blocks binary execution from /tmp, /dev/shm, /var/tmp. Policy-gated, off by default, auto-enables on high-severity threats.
- **XDP allowlist** - operator IPs never dropped, checked before blocklist in kernel.
- **Layered blocking** - single block decision triggers XDP + firewall + Cloudflare + AbuseIPDB in one action.
- **Cross-detector correlation** - same IP in multiple detectors boosts AI confidence (1.15x for 2, 1.30x for 3, 1.50x for 4+).
- **LSM auto-enable** - agent automatically activates kernel execution blocking when it detects download+execute or reverse shell incidents.
- **Smart honeypot routing** - suspicious_login attackers (brute-force followed by success) redirected to honeypot; 20% of new attackers sampled; rest blocked via XDP.
- **AbuseIPDB delayed reporting** - reports queued 5 minutes before sending to allow false-positive correction.
- **Block rate limiter** - max 20 blocks per minute to prevent false-positive cascades.
- **XDP TTL** - blocked IPs auto-expire after 24 hours.
- **LSM process allowlist** - package managers (dpkg, apt, dnf), compilers (gcc, cargo), and system processes always allowed to execute from /tmp.
- **Sensor HUD dashboard** - new default home page with Chart.js area timeline, threat gauge, polar area detector chart. Design matches innerwarden.com (surface-card, cyber-gradient-text, JetBrains Mono).
- **Removed Falco integration** - superseded by native eBPF (kprobe + LSM deeper than Falco's tracepoints).
- **Deprecated Fail2ban** - native detectors + XDP firewall are faster and smarter.

19 detectors, 11 skills, 6 eBPF kernel programs, 692 tests.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-21

### Phase 2 - eBPF Deep Visibility

- **eBPF kernel tracing** - 3 tracepoints running in production (execve, connect, openat) via Aya framework on kernel 6.8
- **Container awareness** - `cgroup_id` captured in kernel space via `bpf_get_current_cgroup_id()`, container IDs resolved from `/proc/<pid>/cgroup` (Docker, Podman, k8s)
- **Process tree tracking** - ppid resolved via `/proc/<pid>/status`, full parent-child chain in event details
- **C2 callback detector** - beaconing analysis (coefficient of variation), C2 port monitoring, data exfiltration detection (10+ unique IPs from one process)
- **Process tree detector** - 26 suspicious lineage patterns: web server → shell, database → shell, Java/Node.js RCE, container runtime escape
- **Container escape detector** - nsenter, chroot, mount, modprobe from containers; Docker socket access, /proc/kcore reads, host sensitive file access
- **File access monitoring** - real-time sensitive path monitoring via openat tracepoint with kernel-space filtering (/etc/, /root/.ssh/, /home/*/.ssh/)
- **18 detectors** total (up from 14), 699 tests passing, sensor at 29MB RAM with all tracepoints active

---

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-20

### Telegram personality overhaul

- **Hacker-partner voice** - all Telegram messages now speak with the personality of a skilled security operator, not a robotic monitoring system
- **Guard mode quips** - incident alerts in GUARD and DRY-RUN modes now include context-aware one-liners per threat type
- **Action reports** - post-kill messages use confidence-scaled quips: "Clean kill. Zero doubt." / "Textbook containment."
- **Mode descriptions** - GUARD: "Threats get neutralized on sight. You get the report." / WATCH: "I flag everything, you make the call."
- **/threats** - visual severity icons, relative time (3h ago), cleaner spacing
- **/decisions** - action-specific icons (block/suspend/honeypot/monitor/kill), confidence + mode display
- **/blocked** - "Kill list" header with count
- **AbuseIPDB auto-block** - "Instant kill - AbuseIPDB reputation gate" / "Dropped on sight - known threat, no AI needed."
- **Honeypot** - "Live target acquired" / "trap them or drop them?" / session debrief with "Their playbook:" heading

### Fixed

- **CrowdSec rate-limit** - cap new blocks per sync to 50 (configurable via `max_per_sync`), preventing OOM when CAPI returns 10k+ IPs. Trim `known_ips` at 10k to prevent unbounded memory growth.
- **Last Portuguese strings removed** - honeypot buttons (Bloquear/Monitorar/Ignorar), toast messages, and monitoring callback all translated to English

---

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-20

### Security hardening (red team response)

- **Config self-monitoring** - integrity detector always monitors `/etc/innerwarden/*`, detects config tampering
- **Protected IP ranges** - AI can never block RFC1918/loopback IPs, decisions downgraded to ignore
- **Hash-chained audit trail** - each decision includes SHA-256 of the previous, tampering breaks the chain
- **Minimal sudoers** - ufw/iptables/nftables rules restricted to deny/delete/status only (no disable, flush, or reset)
- **Dashboard blocks actions over insecure HTTP** - operator actions disabled when auth is configured on non-localhost without TLS
- **Telegram destructive command warnings** - `/enable` and `/disable` show warning before execution
- **Prompt sanitization on all AI providers** - Anthropic provider now sanitizes attacker-controlled fields (was OpenAI/Ollama only)
- **Disk exhaustion protection** - events file capped at 200MB/day
- **Constant-time auth** - dashboard username comparison prevents timing attacks
- **Ed25519 binary signatures** - `innerwarden upgrade` verifies release signatures when `.sig` sidecars are present
- **Minimal sudoers** - ufw/iptables/nftables restricted to deny/delete/status only (no disable, flush, or reset)
- **Dashboard blocks actions over insecure HTTP** - operator actions disabled when auth configured on non-localhost without TLS

---

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-19

### New commands
- **`innerwarden backup`** - archive configs to tar.gz for safe upgrades
- **`innerwarden metrics`** - events per collector, incidents per detector, AI latency, uptime

### Security hardening
- **Disk exhaustion protection** - events file capped at 200MB/day, auto-pauses writes
- **Constant-time auth** - dashboard username comparison prevents timing attacks
- **Prompt sanitization on all providers** - Anthropic provider now sanitizes attacker-controlled strings (was OpenAI/Ollama only)

### Performance
- **Dashboard 15x faster** - overview loads in 0.2s instead of 3s by counting lines instead of parsing 165MB of events JSON

### New detector
- **osquery anomaly** - promotes High/Critical osquery events (sudoers, SUID, authorized_keys, crontab) to incidents

### Fixes
- **install.sh preserves configs** - detects existing installation and skips config overwrite on upgrade
- **Dashboard protection-first UX** - hero shows "Server Protected" with containment rate, resolved incidents faded

---

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-19

### Security hardening

- **Dashboard login rate limiting** - after 5 failed login attempts within 15 minutes, the IP is blocked from trying again. Returns HTTP 429. Prevents brute-force on the dashboard itself.
- **Ban escalation for repeat offenders** - when an IP is blocked more than once, the decision reason is annotated with "repeat offender (blocked N times)". Flows through to Telegram, audit trail, and AbuseIPDB reports.
- **Dashboard HTTPS warning** - warns when the dashboard runs with auth on a non-localhost address over HTTP. Credentials would be sent in plaintext.
- **AI prompt injection sanitization** - attacker-controlled strings (usernames, paths, summaries) are sanitized before injection into the AI prompt. Control characters stripped, whitespace normalized.

### CrowdSec integration

- CrowdSec installed and enrolled on production server. Community blocklist flowing - known bad IPs are blocked preventively before they attack.

### Other

- Data retention enabled (7-day auto-cleanup of JSONL files)
- Watchdog cron (10-min health check, auto-restart + Telegram alert)
- OpenClaw skill published on ClawHub (innerwarden-security v1.0.3, "Benign" verdict)

---

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-19

### NPM log support
- **Nginx Proxy Manager format** - the nginx_access collector now auto-detects and parses NPM log format (`[Client IP]` style). Sites behind Docker NPM are now protected by search_abuse, user_agent_scanner, and web_scan detectors.

### Bot detection
- **Known good bot whitelist** - 25+ legitimate crawlers (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc.) excluded from abuse detection.
- **rDNS verification** - for major search engine bots, the sensor verifies the IP via reverse DNS. Fake Googlebots (spoofed user-agent) are tagged `bot:spoofed` and treated as attackers.

### OpenClaw integration
- **innerwarden-security skill** - OpenClaw skill that installs Inner Warden, validates commands, monitors health, and fixes issues. Auto-detects AI provider. Prompt injection defense built in.

### Fixes
- **All strings in English** - removed all Portuguese from dashboard, Telegram, and agent messages.
- **max_completion_tokens** - auto-detects newer OpenAI models (gpt-5.x, o1, o3) that require the new parameter.
- **systemd dependency** - agent no longer dies when sensor restarts (Requires → Wants).

---

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-18

### New detectors

- **Suricata IDS detector** - repeated alerts from same source IP → incident → block-ip
- **Docker anomaly detector** - rapid container restarts / OOM kills → incident → block-container
- **File integrity detector** - any change to monitored files (passwd, shadow, sudoers) → Critical incident

### Telegram follow-up

- **Fail2ban block notifications** - when fail2ban blocks an IP, Telegram now sends a follow-up message confirming the block or reporting failures. Previously only the initial "Live threat" alert was sent.

### Dashboard

- **Incident outcome field** - API now returns `outcome` (blocked/suspended/open) and `action_taken` for each incident by cross-referencing decisions.

### Fixes

- **install.sh: remove NoNewPrivileges from agent service** - the flag prevented sudo from working, breaking all response skills (ufw, iptables, sudoers). Sensor keeps the restriction.
- **Falco and osquery docs** - honest "Current Limitations" sections explaining they provide context but don't trigger automated actions yet.

---
