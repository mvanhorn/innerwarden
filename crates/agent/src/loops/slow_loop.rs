// ── Disk-low guard for SQLite blob writes ────────────────────────────
//
// Operational fix for the 2026-04-25 02:59 UTC class of hangs: when
// `/var/lib/innerwarden` (the SQLite + JSONL data dir) drops below a
// safe threshold, a blob write inside `process_narrative_tick` can
// block on disk-full indefinitely while holding a writer lock from the
// r2d2 pool. The held lock then cascades into the same tokio runtime
// deadlock observed on the production agent (18-19 threads in
// `futex_wait_queue`).
//
// Strategy: before the KG snapshot write (the largest blob, ~5 MB
// gzipped, ~50 MB uncompressed in transit), call `df -B1 <data_dir>`
// and skip if free space is dangerously low. Cheap to fork once per
// 60 s tick; matches the pattern already used by
// `neural_lifecycle::train_nightly_with_store`'s disk guard.
//
// Thresholds: skip if free < 5 % of total OR free < 500 MB absolute.
// 5 % alone is too lenient for large disks; 500 MB alone is too
// generous for small disks. The OR captures both extremes.
//
// Behavior under low disk:
//   - skip the write (no retry, no buffer)
//   - WARN log with avail/total/pct + path
//   - bump `DISK_LOW_SKIPS_KG_SNAPSHOT` counter (Prometheus surface
//     via `/metrics`)
// Failure mode of the helper itself: if `df` fails to parse, the
// guard returns `false` (fail-open). Better to attempt the write
// than to skip writes forever on a parse-format change.

/// Total skipped KG snapshot writes due to low disk. Exposed via
/// `/metrics` as `innerwarden_disk_low_skips_total{operation="kg_snapshot"}`.

// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Standing gate for the per-tick allocation cost of
// `process_narrative_tick`. The slow loop runs this function every ~30 s
// in production; each tick does a dozen unrelated jobs (narrative
// generation, telemetry, DNA processing, kill-chain, firmware/hypervisor
// ticks, correlation, baseline learning, src_ip backfill, ...). A
// regression in any of them surfaces here as sustained RSS growth
// between ticks.
//
// **What is measured**: `dhat::HeapStats::total_bytes` delta across a
// single `process_narrative_tick` await. Counts cumulative new
// allocations in the window (including tokio task polls, futures, and
// every downstream ingest/write path). Same metric as phase 2.
//
// **Why `total_bytes` not `max_bytes`**: identical rationale to
// phase 2's `save_to_store` anchor — `total_bytes` tracks churn, which
// is what drives the operator-visible RSS trend. `max_bytes` is also
// printed for diagnostics but not asserted.
//
// **Fixture**: a realistic "moderate-load" tick — 10 events inserted
// into the SQLite store across a mix of kinds (ssh.login_success,
// process.exec, network.outbound_connect, dns.query), plus the
// deep_security_snapshot attachment and cooldown-reset pattern that the
// existing `process_narrative_tick_reads_sqlite_events_and_updates_operator_ips`
// test uses. Exercises the happy-path allocation surface.
//
// **Warm-up**: one tick runs before measurement. The first tick
// initialises the telemetry writer, opens deferred SQLite statement
// caches, and warms up tokio's internal allocators — those are
// process-lifetime costs, not the per-tick regression signal.
//
// **Thread-safety / mandatory `--test-threads=1`**: identical constraint
// to phase 2. DHAT's `HeapStats::get()` reads a process-global counter;
// concurrent tests contaminate the delta. See the phase-2 module doc in
// `knowledge_graph/persistence.rs` for the full rationale.
//
// **Baselining** follows the phase-2 convention:
//   BUDGET = ceil(measurement × 1.10 / 100 KiB) × 100 KiB
// Raises require updating this constant AND the matching line in
// `.claude-local/IMPACT.md` "Memory layout" (landing in phase 5) in
// the same PR, with the reason.
