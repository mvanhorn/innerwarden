//! Key invariants:
//! - The audit trail (history) only records **terminal** states. An entry
//!   marked `expired`/`manual`/`already_absent` means the revert command
//!   was confirmed to have succeeded or the rule was confirmed to be absent.
//!   `orphaned` means the system has given up trying to revert — the rule
//!   may still be active in the kernel/firewall.
//! - While retries are in flight, the entry stays in `active` with its
//!   current state (`RevertFailed`) so dashboards can surface the drift.
//! - `is_tracked` treats all non-terminal states as "still active" to avoid
//!   duplicate registration while a retry is in progress.
